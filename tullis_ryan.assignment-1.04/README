README assignment-1.04

     This assignment included the random generation of monsters. Currently
there are 16 types of monsters and they are represented the the 16
hexadecimal digits (0-F). Each of these monsters have their behavior set
by a combination of 4 behavioral traits. Intelligence determines if the
monster follows the shortest path or that of a straight line. Telepathy
determines whether the monster can see where the player is no matter what
or if it needs to have line of sight. Tunneling determines if the monster
can go through walls or if it must follow the dungeon layout. The erratic
trait gives the monster a 50% chance to ignore its other traits and just
move randomly.
     Currently the player moves around at random. If a monster moves onto
the player it is game over and the program will end. If the player manages to
move onto all of the monsters, thus killing them (fools), then victory text
will appear and the program will end.

README assignment-1.10

For this weeks assignment we choose to implement a few extra functions
to make our dungeon better. First we added commands to display a few
extra ways of rendering the dungeon. these include rendering a
1. hardness map
2. tunneling distance map
3. non tunneling distance map
4. terrain map
As well as adding these functions we decided to update the save and load
functions of the dungeon to bring them up to date with a dungeon
containing monsters and objects.

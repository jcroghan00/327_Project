README assignment-1.08

This weeks assignment was about generating the monsters and objects
that we parsed in from a file last week.

Monsters were created using the attributes that will determine how they
act and spawn. Unique monsters are only able to be spawned once. Monster
colors are also used to help differentiate from other monsters.

The object parser and spawning works almost identically to the way that
monsters are handled.

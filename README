README assignment-1.10

For this weeks assignment we choose to implement a few extra functions
to make our dungeon better. First we added commands to display a few
extra ways of rendering the dungeon. these include rendering a
1. hardness map
2. tunneling distance map
3. non tunneling distance map
4. terrain map
As well as adding these functions we decided to update the save and load
functions of the dungeon to bring them up to date with a dungeon
containing monsters and objects. We also added some more functionality to the
look at monsters function by displaying a monsters colored name,HP, damage
range,and speed when your cursor is hovered over them before you select them.
We also added an improvment to our hardness map, detailed earlier, that allows
you to hover over a cell and display its exact hardness and position.

README assignment-1.07

Assignment 1.07 focused on parsing monster descriptions from the monster.txt file. We had to make sure that we got all the attributes

describing each monster, and parse it properly so that we can print it to the terminal. Some difficulties that we went through is finding 

ways to actually retrieve the information. We decided to scan the file line by line. With each line that we retrieve, we convert it to a string

and use a delimiter to break apart the string. This allowed us to find certain words that allowed us to know the monster, and correct attributes. 

Other than that this assignment was very straight forward, and being able to implement these certain monsters in further assignments will allow

us to know a little more about each monster.

README assignment-1.05

     This assignment involved the conversion of our code over to ncurses.
     the only significant changes are to the move pc function and the
     rendering of the dungeon. The rendering of the dungeon mostly just
     had to print to ncurses instead of the terminal. move pc however has
     to now  wait for an input from the player and act on that input
     accordingly. We also added the ability to print the terrrain map and
     added boilerplate code of future implementations of the hardness,
     tunneling distance, and non tunneling distance map. our code also
     prints a win/lose screen and allows a player to quit or restart after
     a game.

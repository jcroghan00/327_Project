     Assignment-1.02 is the first assignment I've worked with a partner on.
We decided that it would be best to use the instructor's code posted on
piazza to get started on code we knew we could expand upon.
     We started by allowing the program to use switches to determine whether
or not a file was to be loaded or saved. We chose to use "--load" and
"--save" respectively.
     The first new function that was started was the load_dungeon function.
The load dungeon function is able to load a binary file from the user's home
directory and translate it into a usable dungeon by the program.
    The other new fucntion is save_dungeon. The save_dungeon function saves
the currently generated dungeon to a binary file in the user's home directory.
    The ability to randomly generate the player characters position was also
added for this assignment as well as the apility to print the playable
charachter to the console.

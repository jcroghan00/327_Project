README assignment-1.06

Assignment 1.06 focused on converting our C Dungeon Generator game into C++, and make all .c files into .cpp files. We had to change all the type def structs into classes. 

Also we had to change the view of the PC to “night vision” which made the PC able to see only 2 grid spots from any direction. But whenever the PC moved, we made sure to update the spots the PC can see , while adding the spots the PC already remembers. 

We also created a toggle function, which lets us change the map to “night vision” or allow us to view the entire map. 

For teleporting we decided to add another window which had a cursor that allowed the user to move wherever in the dungeon (except immutable wall) and let the user make the pc teleport to a desired target location. The user can also choose to set the pc to a random location, and that would teleport the pc to a random location.

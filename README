README assignment-1.03

     1.03 was all about the monster pathfinding algorithm for the dungeon.
We started with our code from 1.02 that was built off of the instructor's
code from 1.01.
     The non-tunneling monsters pathfinding only checks the areas that are
accessible via traveling over rooms or corridors. The tunneling monster is
able to travel over or through any surface and will prioritize tiles with
less hardness.
     All of the distance checking starts at the players location and will
check all of the viable areas of the dungeon to see how many steps they
should take.
     Currently both of the distance maps are printed to the console along
with the standard dungeon output.
